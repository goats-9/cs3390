2. Open the source code using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code (with the Jupyter
   Notebook Extension).

Note that there are no datasets in the zip file. This is because the datasets
are downloaded from the appropriate URLs before use. **Running the code requires
an internet connection**. In case you do not have an internet connection while
running the codes, please download both datasets and from the appropriate URL
beforehand and place a copy each in directories `P1` and `P2`.
